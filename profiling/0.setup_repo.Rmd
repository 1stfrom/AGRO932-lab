# provide step-by-step instructions for setting up a github repo

## Step 1: Create a new repository on GitHub

- Log in to your GitHub account.
- Click the + icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.
- Fill in the repository details:
  - Repository name: Choose a name for your repo.
  - Description: Add a short description (optional).
  - Public/Private: Choose visibility (public or private).
  - Initialize this repository with a README: Check this box to create an initial README file.

- Click Create repository.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine

```{bash, eval-FALSE}
git clone git@github.com:jyanglab/2025-agro932-lab.git
```

Alternatively, you `Fork` the [repository](https://github.com/jyanglab/2025-agro932-lab) to your own account and then clone it to your local machine.

## Step 3: Add Files to the Repository

copy and paste the current `dir system` to the cloned repo.
- You can customize your own dir system using [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/architecture.html)

## Step 4: Create R "New Project" using RStudio

Creating a new R project in RStudio offers several advantages that streamline your workflow, improve organization, and enhance reproducibility.
- Organized workspace with self-contained directories (or environment)
- Improved reproducibility: relative paths, session management, etc.
- Version control integration
